# `dungeon` dependencies

Since this is being developed on linux machines, currently we do not actively support Windows / MacOS, although the release version will be available for all major dektop platforms. 

As this is under heavy development it's not guaranteed that this list is complete or up-to-date, but what's on here is *definitely* needed to build the game. 

__For the most up-to-date list of actual linking dependencies, look at `CMakeLists.txt`!__

1. Run `get_dependencies.sh`. This will clone a few needed github repositories into the include folder.
2. Install the following libraries / packages from your distro's package manager or build them from source:

 * sfml
 * glm
 *
