# Dungeon
### (working title)

A 2D Dungeon Exploration game.

Heavily WIP.

**No license. Don't use, distribute, and so on.**

## How to build

1. Read `dependencies.md`.
2. Run `get_dependencies.sh`.
3. Install everything listed in `dependencies.md`.
4. Run `build.sh` (`dbg.sh` and `release.sh` aren't supported officially).
5. Run `dungeon` from the root project folder with `./bin/dungeon`.
